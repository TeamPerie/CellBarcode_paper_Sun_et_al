## Data

### Samll clone variation data

The old Experiment data:

>   The read Experiment data L394R25.R1.fastq.gz and L394R24.R1.fastq.gz are remove the embryo mammary gland barcode project Wenjie_batch2. The are basal samples.

The current experiment data is the re-amplification of Meghan's UMI seq data.

The simulation condition is described below.

-   300 induced cells with VDJ barcode system
-   Log-normal clone size distribution, with clone size SD of 2 and clone size mean 1.2 | 0.
-   30 PCR cycle, 1e-7 PCR mutation, PCR efficiency 0.705
-   HiSeq 2000 100bp sequencing error profile
